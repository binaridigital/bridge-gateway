## 1. Executive Summary

Bridge Gateway is a reactive API gateway purpose-built for the Bridge financial ecosystem. It serves as the single entry point for all external traffic destined for Bridge platform services. Ingress is exposed at three TLS-terminated hosts via Kubernetes ingress:

- **`gateway.bridgeintelligence.ltd`** — main gateway (all routes)
- **`api.custody.app.d.bridgeintelligence.ltd`** — custody API (same backend; use for API-only access)
- **`custody.app.d.bridgeintelligence.ltd`** — custody UI / console (same backend; use for dashboard access)

The gateway is built on **Spring Cloud Gateway** with **Kotlin** and runs on the **reactive WebFlux/Reactor** stack, providing non-blocking request processing capable of handling high-concurrency workloads without thread-per-request overhead. It currently routes traffic to two backend services -- **bridge-orchestra-api** (the orchestration layer) and **bridge-custody-api** (the custody service) -- with a third route for **bridge-wallet** defined but disabled pending that service's readiness.

Key architectural differentiators include:

- **Plugin-driven extensibility** via a custom SPI (Service Provider Interface) that allows cross-cutting concerns to be composed as independent, lifecycle-managed plugins.
- **Resilience-first design** with per-route circuit breakers, retry policies, time limiters, and structured fallback responses powered by Resilience4j.
- **Observability built in** through Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry distributed tracing, structured JSON audit logging, and reactive health indicators that aggregate plugin health.
- **Security layering** via global filters that enforce request size limits, inject security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), and support API key-based authentication.

The application is containerized as a multi-stage Docker image (Alpine JRE 17), deployed to the `bridge-service-stack` Kubernetes namespace via Kustomize overlays and ArgoCD GitOps, with images hosted on Harbor at `harbor.binari.digital`.

## 2. Purpose & Mission

### 2.1 Primary Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Single Entry Point** | All external traffic enters the Bridge ecosystem through this gateway. No backend service is exposed directly to the internet. |
| **Centralized Authentication** | API key validation is handled at the gateway layer, with OIDC/JWT validation planned for Phase 2. |
| **Centralized Rate Limiting** | Token-bucket rate limiting is enforced per client (by API key or IP address) at the gateway, protecting all downstream services. |
| **Compliance Enforcement** | The compliance plugin (currently disabled) is designed to integrate with the Orbit compliance gateway for KYC/AML screening at the request level. |
| **Audit Trail** | Every request passing through the gateway is logged as a structured JSON audit event, with future Kafka integration for downstream analytics. |
| **Plugin-Driven Extensibility** | New cross-cutting concerns (monetization, compliance, fraud detection) can be added as independent plugins without modifying the gateway core. |
| **Service Mesh Connectivity** | The gateway connects to orchestra, custody, wallet, and (future) bridge-id services via internal Kubernetes DNS, providing a unified external API surface. |

### 2.2 Design Principles

1. **Non-blocking by default.** All request processing is reactive (Project Reactor), ensuring the gateway can sustain high concurrency under load without thread exhaustion.
2. **Fail-safe routing.** Every route has circuit breaker protection with structured fallback responses, so downstream outages produce clean error responses rather than cascading failures.
3. **Configuration-driven.** Routes, plugins, resilience parameters, and security settings are all externalized to YAML configuration, with environment variable overrides for deployment-time customization.
4. **Secrets never in code.** All sensitive values (API keys, Redis passwords) are injected at runtime via Kubernetes Secrets and (when enabled) HashiCorp Vault.
5. **Observable from day one.** Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing, structured logging, and health endpoints are wired into the application from the foundation.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Reactive Request Routing

Bridge Gateway routes external requests to internal backend services based on URL path predicates. The routing engine is built on Spring Cloud Gateway's `RouteLocator` abstraction, with a custom `GatewayRoutesConfig` that reads route definitions from YAML configuration and registers them programmatically at startup.

#### Configured Routes

| Route ID | Path Predicate | Target Service | Port | Status | Circuit Breaker | Retry Policy |
|----------|---------------|----------------|------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| `orchestra-api` | `/api/v1/**` | `bridge-orchestra-api` | 8080 | **Enabled** | `orchestra` (50% threshold) | 3 retries, GET only, 100ms-1s backoff |
| `custody-api` | `/api/v1/custody/**` | `bridge-custody-api` | 8081 | **Enabled** | `custody` (30% threshold) | 2 retries, GET only, 200ms-2s backoff |
| `wallet` | `/api/v1/wallet/**` | `bridge-wallet` | 8080 | **Disabled** | N/A | N/A |

**Route precedence:** The `custody-api` route matches first for `/api/v1/custody/**` paths because Spring Cloud Gateway evaluates more specific path predicates before broader ones. All other `/api/v1/**` traffic is routed to `orchestra-api`.

**Custom route headers:** Each routed request is augmented with an `X-Gateway-Route` header containing the route ID, enabling downstream services to identify which gateway route was matched.

**Dynamic route configuration:** The `GatewayRoutesProperties` configuration class supports runtime route definitions via YAML. Each route definition includes:
- `enabled` -- boolean toggle for enable/disable without code changes
- `path` -- URL path predicate
- `uri` -- target service URI (overridable via environment variables)
- `stripPrefix` -- number of path segments to strip before forwarding
- `methods` -- optional HTTP method filter
- `plugins` -- list of plugin IDs to activate for this route

#### Route Target URIs (Dev Profile)

| Route | Default URI | Dev Override (K8s DNS) |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| Orchestra | `http://bridge-orchestra-api:8080` | `http://bridge-orchestra-api.bridge-service-stack.svc.cluster.local:8080` |
| Custody | `http://bridge-custody-api:8081` | `http://bridge-custody-api.bridge-service-stack.svc.cluster.local:8081` |
| Wallet | `http://bridge-wallet:8080` | `http://bridge-wallet.bridge-service-stack.svc.cluster.local:8080` |

---

### 3.2 Global Filter Chain

The gateway implements five global filters that execute on every request in a strict order. These filters are implemented as Spring Cloud Gateway `GlobalFilter` components with `Ordered` interface to control execution sequence.

#### Filter Execution Order

| Order | Filter | Responsibility |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **-4** | `RequestSizeLimitFilter` | Rejects requests exceeding the configured maximum body size (default: 10 MB / 10,485,760 bytes). Returns `413 Payload Too Large` with `X-Max-Request-Size` header. |
| **-3** | `SecurityHeadersFilter` | Injects security response headers on every response: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, Cache-Control, Pragma, and X-Gateway-Version. |
| **-2** | `CorrelationIdFilter` | Ensures every request has an `X-Correlation-Id` header. If the incoming request already carries one, it is preserved and propagated. If not, a new UUID v4 is generated. The correlation ID is added to both the forwarded request and the response. |
| **-1** | `RequestLoggingFilter` | Logs structured request/response information including HTTP method, path, correlation ID, client IP, response status code, and request duration in milliseconds. |
| **0** | `PluginChainFilter` | Executes the plugin chain in two phases: PRE_ROUTE plugins run before downstream forwarding (and can short-circuit the request), POST_ROUTE plugins run after the response is received. |

#### Security Headers Applied

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` |
| `X-XSS-Protection` | `1; mode=block` |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` |
| `Cache-Control` | `no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate` |
| `Pragma` | `no-cache` |
| `X-Gateway-Version` | `1.0.0` |

---

### 3.3 Plugin System (SPI Architecture)

The plugin system is the gateway's primary extensibility mechanism. It follows a Service Provider Interface (SPI) pattern where plugins implement a common `GatewayPlugin` interface and are automatically discovered, registered, and managed by the `PluginRegistry`.

#### GatewayPlugin Interface

```kotlin
interface GatewayPlugin {
    val id: String          // Unique identifier
    val name: String        // Human-readable name
    val version: String     // Semantic version
    val phase: PluginPhase  // PRE_ROUTE, POST_ROUTE, or BOTH
    val order: Int          // Execution order within phase

    fun initialize(config: Map<String, Any>)
    fun execute(exchange: ServerWebExchange, context: PluginContext): Mono<PluginResult>
    fun shutdown()
    fun isEnabled(): Boolean
    fun healthCheck(): Mono<PluginHealth>
}
```

#### Plugin Lifecycle

1. **Discovery** -- At application startup, Spring component scanning discovers all `@Component` classes implementing `GatewayPlugin`.
2. **Registration** -- The `PluginRegistry` registers each discovered plugin by its `id` in a `ConcurrentHashMap`.
3. **Initialization** -- For each plugin with `enabled: true` in the YAML configuration, `initialize(config)` is called with the plugin's settings map.
4. **Execution** -- During request processing, the `PluginChainFilter` retrieves enabled plugins for the current phase (sorted by `order`) and executes them sequentially.
5. **Short-Circuiting** -- Any PRE_ROUTE plugin can return `PluginResult(proceed = false)` to short-circuit the request with a custom status code and response body.
6. **Error Isolation** -- Plugin execution errors are caught and logged; a failing plugin does not break the request chain (it is treated as `proceed = true`).
7. **Shutdown** -- On application shutdown (or plugin disable), `shutdown()` is called to release resources.
8. **Health Checking** -- Each plugin exposes a reactive `healthCheck()` method that is aggregated by the `GatewayHealthIndicator` into the `/actuator/health` endpoint.

#### Plugin Execution Context

Each plugin receives a `PluginContext` containing:
- `routeId` -- The matched route identifier
- `correlationId` -- The request's correlation ID
- `metadata` -- A mutable map for passing data between plugins in the chain

#### Plugin Result

Each plugin returns a `PluginResult` containing:
- `proceed` -- Whether to continue the chain or short-circuit
- `statusCode` -- HTTP status code (used when `proceed = false`)
- `responseBody` -- Response body string (used when `proceed = false`)
- `headers` -- Additional response headers to inject
- `metadata` -- Data to merge into the plugin context

#### Built-in Plugins

| Plugin ID | Name | Phase | Order | Default State | Description |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `audit` | Audit Logging Plugin | `POST_ROUTE` | 10 | **Enabled** | Logs structured JSON audit events for every request, including timestamp, correlation ID, route ID, HTTP method, path, status code, client IP, user agent, and masked API key. Designed for future Kafka publishing to `gateway.audit.events`. |
| `compliance` | Compliance Plugin | `PRE_ROUTE` | 50 | **Disabled** | Skeleton for KYC/AML compliance checks via the Orbit compliance gateway. When fully implemented, will validate entity compliance status and block sanctioned or unverified users. Currently operates in passthrough mode. |
| `monetization` | Monetization Plugin | `PRE_ROUTE` | 100 | **Disabled** | Skeleton for API monetization. When fully implemented, will check usage quotas against a billing service, enforce plan-based rate limits, and track API call metering. Currently applies a free-tier header to all requests. |

#### Plugin Admin API

Runtime plugin management is exposed via the `PluginAdminController` at `/gateway/admin/plugins`:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/gateway/admin/plugins` | List all plugins with status (id, name, version, phase, order, enabled, healthy) |
| `GET` | `/gateway/admin/plugins/{id}` | Get detailed information for a specific plugin including health status |
| `POST` | `/gateway/admin/plugins/{id}/enable` | Enable a plugin with provided configuration (JSON body) |
| `POST` | `/gateway/admin/plugins/{id}/disable` | Disable a running plugin and release its resources |
| `GET` | `/gateway/admin/plugins/{id}/health` | Get health status of a specific plugin |

### 3.4 Authentication & Authorization

#### API Key Authentication

The `ApiKeyAuthGatewayFilterFactory` provides API key validation as a route-level gateway filter. It supports:

- **Header-based key extraction** -- Reads the API key from the `X-API-Key` header (configurable header name).
- **Configurable enforcement** -- The `required` flag controls whether the filter rejects requests without a key (`401 Unauthorized`) or allows them through.
- **Key validation** -- Submitted keys are checked against a configured whitelist loaded from the `GATEWAY_API_KEYS` environment variable (sourced from Vault in production).
- **Structured error responses** -- Returns JSON error bodies with appropriate HTTP status codes:
  - `401 Unauthorized` -- Missing API key when required
  - `403 Forbidden` -- Invalid API key

#### Rate Limiting

The `RateLimitGatewayFilterFactory` implements token-bucket rate limiting as a route-level filter:

- **Per-client buckets** -- Each unique client (identified by API key, or by IP address if no key is present) gets an independent token bucket.
- **Configurable parameters** -- `requestsPerSecond` (default: 10.0) and `burstCapacity` (default: 20).
- **Token refill** -- Tokens are refilled based on elapsed time since the last refill, using atomic operations for thread safety.
- **Response headers** -- Every response includes `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers.
- **Rate limit exceeded** -- Returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After: 1` header and JSON error body.

**Current limitation:** Token buckets are stored in-memory (`ConcurrentHashMap`), which means rate limits are per-instance and not shared across gateway replicas. Distributed rate limiting via Redis is planned.

---

### 3.5 Resilience

The gateway implements a comprehensive resilience strategy using Resilience4j, configured both programmatically (via `ResilienceConfig`) and declaratively (via `application.yml`).

#### Circuit Breaker Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Custody Override |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Failure rate threshold | 50% | 30% |
| Slow call rate threshold | 80% | (inherits default) |
| Slow call duration threshold | 5 seconds | (inherits default) |
| Wait duration in open state | 30 seconds | 60 seconds |
| Permitted calls in half-open | 5 | (inherits default) |
| Sliding window size | 20 calls | 10 calls |
| Sliding window type | COUNT_BASED | (inherits default) |
| Minimum number of calls | 10 | (inherits default) |

**Rationale for tighter custody thresholds:** The custody service handles cryptographic key operations and signing -- operations where failures may indicate security-critical issues. The lower failure threshold (30%) and longer wait duration (60s) ensure the gateway is more conservative about sending traffic to a potentially compromised custody service.

#### Time Limiter Configuration

| Service | Timeout Duration |
|---------|-----------------|
| Default (all routes) | 10 seconds |
| Custody | 15 seconds |

#### Retry Configuration

| Route | Retries | Methods | First Backoff | Max Backoff | Factor |
|-------|---------|---------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Orchestra | 3 | GET | 100ms | 1,000ms | 2x |
| Custody | 2 | GET | 200ms | 2,000ms | 2x |

**Note:** Retries are only applied to GET requests to avoid retrying non-idempotent operations.

#### Fallback Endpoints

When a circuit breaker opens, traffic is forwarded to internal fallback controllers that return structured JSON responses:

| Fallback Path | Service | Retry After |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `/fallback/orchestra` | bridge-orchestra-api | 30 seconds |
| `/fallback/custody` | bridge-custody-api | 60 seconds |
| `/fallback/default` | Generic | 30 seconds |

**Fallback response format:**
```json
{
    "error": "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE",
    "message": "Orchestra service is temporarily unavailable. Please retry shortly.",
    "service": "bridge-orchestra-api",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-27T12:00:00Z",
    "retryAfter": 30
}
```

### 3.7 Security

#### WebFlux Security Configuration

The `SecurityConfig` class configures Spring Security for the reactive WebFlux stack:

- **CSRF protection:** Disabled (API gateway, not a browser-rendered application)
- **HTTP Basic:** Disabled
- **Form Login:** Disabled
- **Authorization:** All exchanges currently `permitAll()` (authentication is handled at the filter/plugin level, not the Spring Security level)

#### Security Headers

All responses include the hardened security headers listed in Section 3.2. These headers provide:

- **Clickjacking protection** via `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- **MIME type sniffing protection** via `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- **XSS protection** via `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- **Transport security** via HSTS with 1-year max-age and includeSubDomains
- **Referrer leakage prevention** via `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- **Feature restriction** via `Permissions-Policy` disabling camera, microphone, geolocation
- **Cache prevention** via `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate`

#### Request Size Limiting

The `RequestSizeLimitFilter` rejects requests with `Content-Length` exceeding 10 MB (10,485,760 bytes), returning `413 Payload Too Large`.

#### CORS Configuration

CORS is configured at two levels:

1. **Spring Cloud Gateway global CORS** -- Applied via `spring.cloud.gateway.globalcors` in YAML
2. **Custom CorsConfig** -- A programmatic `CorsWebFilter` bean with the following settings:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Allowed Origins | `https://orchestrator.binari.digital`, `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:5173` |
| Allowed Methods | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS |
| Allowed Headers | `*` |
| Exposed Headers | `X-Correlation-Id`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-Monetization-Plan` |
| Allow Credentials | `true` (main config), `false` (CORS bean default) |
| Max Age | 3600 seconds |

#### TLS Termination

TLS is terminated at the Kubernetes ingress layer:
- **Ingress class:** nginx
- **Certificate issuer:** `letsencrypt-prod` (cert-manager)
- **TLS secret:** `bridge-gateway-tls`
- **SSL redirect:** Enforced via annotation

## 10. Opportunities

The following enhancements represent concrete opportunities to expand the gateway's capabilities:

### 10.1 Authentication & Identity

| Opportunity | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **OIDC/Keycloak Integration** | Integrate with Keycloak at `keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:80` for JWT-based authentication. Validate access tokens, extract claims (roles, permissions, tenant), and propagate identity headers to downstream services. | High |
| **bridge-id Service** | Connect to the bridge-id identity service for user profile resolution, social login (Google, Apple, GitHub), and multi-factor authentication orchestration. | High |
| **JWT Claim Propagation** | Extract JWT claims (sub, roles, permissions, tenant_id) and inject them as standardized headers (X-User-Id, X-User-Roles, X-Tenant-Id) for downstream consumption. | High |
| **Scoped API Keys** | Enhance API key validation with scopes, rate limit tiers, and expiration dates. Associate API keys with tenants for multi-tenant isolation. | Medium |

### 10.2 Event Architecture

| Opportunity | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Kafka Event Bus** | Publish gateway audit events to `gateway.audit.events` Kafka topic (already configured in AuditPlugin settings). Enables downstream analytics, compliance reporting, and real-time monitoring. Kafka is available at `bridge-kafka.bridge-service-stack.svc.cluster.local:9092`. | High |
| **Redis Streams** | Use Redis Streams for real-time event propagation to the console UI (WebSocket bridge). | Medium |
| **Event Sourcing** | Record all gateway decisions (route, auth, rate limit, compliance) as immutable events for audit trail and replay capability. | Low |

### 10.3 Rate Limiting & Traffic Management

| Opportunity | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Distributed Rate Limiting** | Replace in-memory token buckets with Redis-backed rate limiting using Spring Cloud Gateway's built-in `RequestRateLimiter` filter with `RedisRateLimiter`. Enables consistent limits across multiple gateway replicas. | High |
| **Tiered Rate Limiting** | Different rate limits per API key tier (free, starter, professional, enterprise) driven by the monetization plugin. | Medium |
| **Request Throttling** | Gradual request slowdown (via delayed responses) instead of hard rejection at rate limits. | Low |

### 10.4 API Monetization

| Opportunity | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Usage Metering** | Track per-client API call counts by endpoint, method, and response status. Publish to analytics pipeline for billing. | Medium |
| **Plan Enforcement** | The monetization plugin skeleton is already in place. Connect it to a billing service to enforce quota limits and return `402 Payment Required` when exceeded. | Medium |
| **Usage Dashboard** | Expose per-client usage statistics via an admin API endpoint. | Low |

### 10.5 Protocol Support

| Opportunity | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **WebSocket Support** | Add WebSocket route support for real-time features (trade execution, balance updates, notification streams). | Medium |
| **gRPC Gateway** | Add gRPC-to-REST transcoding for internal gRPC services that need external REST exposure. | Low |
| **GraphQL Federation** | Implement a GraphQL gateway that federates schemas from orchestra, custody, and wallet services into a unified graph. | Low |
| **Server-Sent Events** | SSE support for long-lived notification streams. | Low |

### 10.6 Compliance & Security

| Opportunity | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Orbit Compliance Integration** | Activate the compliance plugin and connect it to the Orbit compliance gateway for real-time KYC/AML screening. | High |
| **IP Geolocation** | Enrich requests with geolocation data for compliance (sanctions screening, jurisdictional routing). | Medium |
| **Request/Response Encryption** | End-to-end payload encryption for sensitive operations (key material, signing requests). | Medium |
| **Admin API Authentication** | Secure the `/gateway/admin/**` endpoints with authentication (currently open). | High |
| **Vault Activation** | Enable Vault auto-configuration for runtime secret injection, removing the need for Kubernetes Secrets with placeholder values. | High |

### 10.7 Caching & Performance

| Opportunity | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Response Caching** | Redis-backed response caching for idempotent GET endpoints with configurable TTLs per route. | Medium |
| **Request Deduplication** | Detect and collapse duplicate concurrent requests (same key + path + body hash). | Low |
| **Connection Pooling** | Tune Reactor Netty connection pool settings for each downstream service. | Medium |

### 10.8 Flows & Journeys Engine

| Opportunity | Description | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Composable Operations** | Allow clients to define multi-step "flows" (e.g., create account -> fund account -> initiate transfer) as a single API call. | Medium |
| **Saga Orchestration** | Gateway-level saga coordination for multi-service operations with compensation logic. | Low |
| **Journey Templates** | Predefined journey templates for common workflows (onboarding, trading, settlement). | Low |

## 12. Risk Assessment

### 12.1 Security Risks

| Risk | Severity | Current State | Mitigation |
|------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **No JWT validation** | **High** | The gateway does not validate JWTs. All authorization is via API key or fully open. Any client with network access can call any endpoint. | Phase 2: Integrate Keycloak OIDC resource server with JWT validation. |
| **Admin endpoints open** | **High** | `/gateway/admin/**` endpoints are exposed without authentication. Anyone who can reach the gateway can list routes, view configuration, and enable/disable plugins. | Phase 2: Secure admin endpoints with JWT or dedicated admin API key. |
| **Vault not activated** | **Medium** | Vault integration is configured but disabled. Secrets are currently managed via Kubernetes Secrets with Vault placeholder references that are not being resolved. | Phase 1: Enable Vault auto-configuration and provision the `bridge-gateway` Vault role. |
| **CORS wide open in dev** | **Medium** | The dev profile sets `allowedOriginPatterns: "*"` with `allowCredentials: true`, which could allow cross-origin attacks if the dev profile is inadvertently used in production. | Ensure profile-specific CORS is enforced per environment. Stage/prod profiles should have restrictive origin lists. |
| **Permissive security chain** | **Low** | Spring Security is configured with `anyExchange().permitAll()`. This is intentional (authentication is at the filter/plugin level), but it means Spring Security provides no protection. | Document this design decision. Consider adding path-based restrictions as authentication matures. |

### 12.2 Scalability Risks

| Risk | Severity | Current State | Mitigation |
|------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **In-memory rate limiting** | **High** | Rate limit token buckets are stored in a local `ConcurrentHashMap`. With multiple gateway replicas, each instance maintains independent counters, allowing clients to exceed intended limits by a factor of N (replicas). | Phase 1: Migrate to Redis-backed `RequestRateLimiter` for distributed rate limiting. |
| **Single replica** | **Medium** | The deployment specifies `replicas: 1`. No horizontal scaling or high availability. | Increase replicas and implement session affinity or stateless design for rate limiting. |
| **Unbounded bucket map** | **Low** | The in-memory rate limit bucket map grows without bound as new client IPs/keys are seen. Over time, this could cause memory pressure. | Implement TTL-based eviction or migrate to Redis. |

### 12.3 Operational Risks

| Risk | Severity | Current State | Mitigation |
|------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Placeholder CI pipeline** | **Medium** | The CI workflow (`ci.yaml`) is a placeholder that only runs `ls -la`. There is no automated testing, linting, or build verification on pull requests. | Complete the CI pipeline with Gradle build, test execution, and code quality checks. |
| **No automated integration tests** | **Medium** | Only basic unit tests exist (application context, plugin registry, correlation filter). No integration tests verify routing, circuit breaking, or plugin execution. | Add integration tests using Spring Cloud Contract or WebTestClient. |
| **No stage/prod overlays** | **Medium** | Only the dev Kustomize overlay exists. Stage and production environments lack deployment configurations. | Phase 4: Create stage and prod overlays with appropriate resource limits and configurations. |
| **Wallet route disabled** | **Low** | The wallet route is defined but disabled. This is intentional but could cause confusion if someone expects wallet endpoints to be available. | Document the wallet route status. Enable when bridge-wallet service is ready. |

### 12.4 Reliability Risks

| Risk | Severity | Current State | Mitigation |
|------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Redis dependency** | **Medium** | Redis is wired as a dependency for rate limiting (reactive client), but if Redis is unavailable, the application behavior depends on Spring auto-configuration fallback. | Add Redis health indicator; implement graceful degradation to in-memory rate limiting when Redis is unavailable. |
| **Plugin failure isolation** | **Low** | Plugin execution errors are caught and logged, but a plugin that hangs (does not complete the Mono) could block the entire request chain. | Add per-plugin timeout enforcement in the PluginChainFilter. |
| **No request body logging** | **Low** | The audit plugin does not log request/response bodies (`log-body: false`). This limits forensic investigation capability. | Make body logging configurable per route with appropriate size limits and PII masking. |
